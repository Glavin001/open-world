  /**
   * Namespace: proj4
   *
   * Proj4js is a JavaScript library to transform point coordinates from one 
   * coordinate system to another, including datum transformations.
   *
   * This library is a port of both the Proj.4 and GCTCP C libraries to JavaScript. 
   * Enabling these transformations in the browser allows geographic data stored 
   * in different projections to be combined in browser-based web mapping 
   * applications.
   * 
   * Proj4js must have access to coordinate system initialization strings (which
   * are the same as for PROJ.4 command line).  Thes can be included in your 
   * application using a <script> tag or Proj4js can load CS initialization 
   * strings from a local directory or a web service such as spatialreference.org.
   *
   * Similarly, Proj4js must have access to projection transform code.  These can
   * be included individually using a <script> tag in your page, built into a 
   * custom build of Proj4js or loaded dynamically at run-time.  Using the
   * -combined and -compressed versions of Proj4js includes all projection class
   * code by default.
   *
   * All coordinates are handled as points which have a .x and a .y property
   * which will be modified in place.
   *
   * Override proj4.reportError for output of alerts and warnings.
   *
   * See http://trac.osgeo.org/proj4js/wiki/UserGuide for full details.

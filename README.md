Open-World
===========
![Halifax Sideview](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1885333/348208/267f485c-9f32-11e2-9931-1fdff5f4e3b6.png?raw=true "Halifax sideview")

The original idea behind "[Open-GTA](https://github.com/tim-speed/openmap-gta)", by [Tim Speed](https://github.com/tim-speed/), was that open data would be used to create a map for an old-style, 2D, GTA clone. 
I felt that 3D is much cooler and also I wanted to focus more on the environment/scenery and the interactiveness with the player, than the feel of GTA. 
I forked the original project in hopes to solidate my goal: to create an open-ended "game" where players could do whatever they wanted in a world that resembled their own.

Test out our current build here: http://140.184.137.122:8081/indexGL.html

## Screenshots
These are old screenshots of walking around Halifax. The current build is much more sophisticated and will become even more appealing in the near future.

## Past
Originally thought to be an old styled GTA game. now with 3D graphics using open map data and much more in the future updates to come!
The original project can be found here: https://github.com/tim-speed/openmap-gta

## Present
WebGL demo: http://140.184.137.122:8081/indexGL.html
- Retrieving OpenStreetMaps data; and
- Display in 3D on a canvas with Three.js

### Installation
- Install Node.js
- npm install socket.io
- The 3D GL version is the file ```indexGL.html``` in the client directory.

## Future
- Physics
- Vehicles
- Players

These are a few screenshots of similar projects, from a 3D display standpoint, **Open-World** will allow players to walk around and interact with the world that is rendered around them.
